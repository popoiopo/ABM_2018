Research-questions:
- Optimal arrangements for the bar
- Time they spend to go to the toilet and bar
- To test the models: make bottleneck-test
- To test the models: the beerconsumptions should be roughly the same 

Input:
- Bar-locations 
- Population-size
- Beer-need (thirst)
- Toilet-need
- Crowd-aversion distance waiting time (?)
- Waiting-time 

Output:
- Total beer-consumption (profits)
- Total waiting time (walking + waiting in line), count the time spent in beer/toilet-mode
- 

Model Ali/Bas:
- 10 min per time step
- Chance of individual in population getting beer/going to toilet 
- 

Model Viktor:
- Thirst increases with time
- Two steps when not in a crowd

Information models:
- 1 grid cell is 0.75 m2
- 1 time step is 1 second
-
